# Descrição do projeto <br>
This is my second landing page 🎉, here we have a capture page where there is a form that the user/customer will fill in with their data to receive event or product information by email. <br><br>

# Função <br>
When there are a number of followers or customers interested in the product or an event, it is very interesting to have a general control of your campaigns sent directly to them. In this form I used the integration with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/pt-br/">Mailchimp</a>, which is a marketing automation platform and email marketing services, widely used in business. So, by filtering the captured emails it is possible to send campaigns and differentiate potential customers.👈<br>

# Tecnologias Utilizadas <br>
HTML, CSS and I made integration with the Mailchimp platform.</br>

Note: Using the lading page in a responsive way on the devices 📲 and making the method attribute equal to “POST” sending the data addressed by action without showing the data in the URL.
